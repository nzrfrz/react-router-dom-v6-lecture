1.  make the login function actually happen. 
    by the time you are clonning this repo, i just created a login function for you, so you guys need to make change about the route.
    NOTE: BEWARE FOR INFINITE LOOP

2.  Time to do a make over for this web.  
    Use antd ui library,then make over all the form including form validation, alert, and notification, 
    also you will learn about css in this task

About form validation, all of this validation below is required, don't miss even a single point

# Registration form
1. Check if email is valid. (see https://prnt.sc/_bbboq28gNPc)
2. Check userName can't be empty. (see https://prnt.sc/hV-I5_17RRDA)
3. Password and confirm password must be match. (see https://prnt.sc/UZIxXhsnVUU3)
4. Disabling button register if all points above not valid. (see https://prnt.sc/lN2-7i8ZF5AI)
5. Create alert to store a message if point 1 to 3 is not valid. (SS on point 1 to 3)
6. Create a loading while hitting to an API. (see https://prnt.sc/jtkUOMBhmB3R)
7. Create notification after successfully register and redirect to login page. (see https://prnt.sc/mKubynnvGlTH)

# Login form
1. Disabled button login if user and password is empty
2. Loading button while hitting to an API
3. Display error message inside notification when password is wrong. (see https://prnt.sc/oTotesjU708A)
4. Also for wrong userName or email. (see https://prnt.sc/H9iwnm6BoAx_)
5. Redirect to whatever your page path after auth

HINT: you can use form component in antd or manual validation using input component

3.  About refresh token and access token.
    let say you have login with your browser, and you get the access token, now try to login with insomnia or postman.  
    
    Case #1 Your web is no longer open in the browser
    After successfully login with insomnia or postman, in your browser after first loading you need to make the web logout automatically
    because your access token revoke.  So you guys need to check whether your current access token is valid or not
    if not valid, you need to redirect user to login page.

    Case #2 Your web is still open in the browser
    Check if your web has any user activity or if you familiar with the word IDLE.  So in other word, check if your web back from IDLE.
    then if the acces token is revoke, take user back to login page.

    HINT: search about react idle
